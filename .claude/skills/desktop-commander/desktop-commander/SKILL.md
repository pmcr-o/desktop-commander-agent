description: Use the Remote Desktop Commander connector as a bounded filesystem and PowerShell runtime adapter for PMCR-O workflows. Read-only discovery is the default; writes and processes require scoped grants.

# Desktop Commander adapter

This skill exposes a generic connector surface that can specialize into domain
children such as sample-child, dotnet-inspect, or a repository-specific
marketplace adapter.

Supported operations:

- list/read/search: read-only discovery of a declared path;
- process: invoke a declared PowerShell or native command with a finite timeout
  and capped output;
- write: write only to an explicitly authorized project path;
- handoff: return exact paths, command output, exit state, hashes, and a next
  seed to the orchestrator.

The adapter does not provide delete, credential, publish, or arbitrary-shell
authority. A filesystem listing does not imply write or process permission.
Simulation reports predicted paths and commands with simulation=true and
verified=false. A fresh checker reruns the validator and any declared proof.

PowerShell marketplace skills are composed below this adapter: filesystem/list
for discovery, invoke for one relative script, checks for auth inspection,
and domain-specific skills for actual behavior. The adapter provides mechanics;
PMCR-O still owns routing, caps, evidence, and verdicts.
